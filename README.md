# FYP-Simulating_Spinning_Robots
This repository has the code for the development of our simulation of spinning robots.

Toby:
The most up to date version is Version_4_5. 
This runs our sim for a set period of time outputting the average scalar displacement of our particles from their initial position at each update.
This is th version used for collecting data shown in the end of semester presentation.

Annabel:
The differences between the two most recent versions of the code, 4_5_NEAT and 4_5_texfile_data_output, are the different ways the data is output (one as a text file and one as a csv file). In version 4_5_NEAT you can change the proportion of the particles rotating clockwise and anti-clockwise (this needs to be added to 4_5_textfile_data_output next semester). In version 4_5_textfile_data_output you can quantify and output the values of the overlaps per timestep. This version of the code was used to make my powerpoint for the presentation. I also used Visualise_with_MATPLOTLIB to create some alternate simulations (although I can't work out how to scale the particles according to their diameter and I have not yet worked out how to add an arrow onto the particles to show the rotation about their axis)
