# FYP-Simulating_Spinning_Robots
This repository has the code for the development of our simulation of spinning robots.

The most up to date version is Version_4_5. 
This runs our sim for a set period of time outputting the average scalar displacement of our particles from their initial position at each update.
This is th version used for collecting data shown in the end of semester presentation.
